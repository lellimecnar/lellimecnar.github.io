## Introduction
Unless you _really_ know what you're doing (in which case, you probably don't need this anyway) it will be easiest if you read through this entire page _first_ and then follow the instructions _in order_.

> **TIP:** I decided to buy a bolt of ["tracing fabric"](http://www.joann.com/pellon-interfacing-tracing-material-pattern-white/1540640.html) and create my own pattern pieces, since there will be quite a few modifications (especially to the front). It has worked out well for me, and I highly recommend you do the same.

## Tunic
The [McCall's pattern](https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m4745) has two coat types:

* **A.** single-breasted, upper-thigh length.
* **B.** double-breasted, above-the-knee length.

You'll need to create sort of a hybrid between the two.

Start by mirroring **#2** across the center line so you end up with one single pattern piece of the entire front. This will be the **front template**, and you will create 5 completely new pattern pieces from this one large piece.

### Tunic Front
Fold the **front template** down the _center line_, and mark the half-way point on each shoulder. Overlap the **front template** with pattern piece **#3** so that the _center line_ and the _bottom edge_ are aligned. Add another mark to the _bottom edge_ of the **front template** along the right edge of **#3**.

Set **#3** aside. Draw a dotted line between the two marks (being sure to mirror it on both sides of the front template). This marks the seam line for the double yoke.

>**NOTE:** This dotted line is for reference only, DO NOT CUT ANYTHING ON THIS LINE!!!

Unfold the **front template** and lay it flat. Draw two solid lines ⅝" from each side of the dotted line on the **right**. Label the outside line _"cut for center/left side"_, and the inside line _"cut for right side."_ Draw another solid line ⅝" to the **left** of the dotted line on the **left**, and label it _"cut for center."_

Draw a horizontal line (perpendicular to the _center line_) from the center point of the collar to the outer _"cut for center"_ line on the right, and label it _"cut for left side."_

> **FOR "STRAIGHT YOKE" VARIANTS:** Continue the horizontal line from the _center line_ to the solid _"cut for center" line_ on the **left**, and label it _"cut for center."_

#### Code Cylinder Pockets

> **FOR "NO POCKET" VARIANTS:** Skip this section.

Fold the **front template** down the _center line_ again. Find the vertical midpoint of the sleeve opening, and mark both sides. Unfold the **front template** and draw another dotted line connecting the two marks. This marks the top of where the pockets will be.

> **NOTE:** This dotted line is the _pocket top line_, and again, is for reference only. **DO NOT CUT ANYTHING HERE!!!**

Multiply the seam allowance by 2 (⅝" &times; 2 = 1¼") , and draw two solid horizontal lines that far above and below the dotted _pocket top line_. Label the top line _"cut for bottom"_ and the bottom line _"cut for top."_

> **NOTE:** We double the seam allowance here so we can hide the inner lining seam by offsetting it ⅝" below the top of the pocket opening.

##### Pocket Lining
You need two measurements from the horizontal _pocket top line_:

1. From the _left edge_ to the _"cut for center/left side" line_
1. From the _"cut for right side" line_ to the _right edge_

Using those two measurements as widths, create two new rectangular pattern pieces with a height of 4" plus the seam allowance (4" + ⅝" = 4⅝"). Label the widest one "**2b** Left Pocket _(Lining: cut 1)_" and the other "**2f** Right Pocket _(Lining: cut 1)_." Add a "⬐Fold⬎" mark to the bottom (wide) edge of both pieces.

Set **#2b** and **#2f** aside.

#### Final Front Pieces

### Tunic Back
> **NOTE:** If the costume you're making is for one of the _very few_ characters that have a center back seam, you can skip this step, and just use pattern pieces **#3** & **#4** unaltered.

Fold **#3** along the _center line_ and trace a new pattern piece, adding a "⬐Fold⬎" indicator to the center line. Label this as "**3** Back _(Fabric: cut 1, Lining: cut 1)_"

No modifications are required for **#4**.
