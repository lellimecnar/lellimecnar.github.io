## Pattern Parts
The McCall's pattern has two coat types: "A" is single-breasted, upper-thigh length. "B" is double-breasted and above the knee length. We need to create sort of a hybrid between the two.

I decided to buy a bolt of ["tracing fabric"](http://www.joann.com/pellon-interfacing-tracing-material-pattern-white/1540640.html) and create my own pattern pieces, since there will be quite a few modifications (especially to the front).

We need to start by mirroring #2 across the center line. This will give us one single pattern piece of the entire front. This will become our main template, and we will end up 5 completely new pattern pieces from this one piece.
