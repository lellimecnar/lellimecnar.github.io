{% include officer/pattern-intro.md %}

The [McCall's pattern](https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m4745) has two coat types:

* **A.** single-breasted, upper-thigh length.
* **B.** double-breasted, above-the-knee length.

The Imperial Officer uniform tunic is sort of a hybrid between the two.

## Back
Fold in the seam allowance from the left edge of **#3** to mark the _center line_. Trace a new pattern piece, labeling this new left edge as "Center Back Fold line" and adding a **&darr;Fold&darr;** indicator.

Label this piece: "**3** Back _(Fabric: cut 1, Lining: cut 1)_."

No modifications are required for **#4**.

> **NOTE:** If the costume you're making is for one of the _very few_ characters that have a center back seam, just mark the center line on your pattern piece for a future step, and you can use **#3** & **#4** unaltered.

## Front
Start by mirroring **#2** across the center line so you end up with one single pattern piece of the entire front. This will be the **front template**. You will be tracing several completely new pattern pieces from this one large piece.

<div style="text-align: center">

		<figcaption>Before and after mirroring <strong>#2</strong></figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

Fold the **front template** down the _center line_, and mark the half-way point on each shoulder. Overlap the **front template** with the **#3** pattern piece you traced in a previous step so that the _center lines_ and the _bottom edges_ of both pieces are aligned. Add another mark to the _bottom edge_ of the **front template** along the right edge of **#3**.

Set **#3** aside.

Draw a dotted line between the two marks (being sure to mirror it on both sides of the front template). This marks the seam line for the double yoke.

>**NOTE:** This dotted line is for reference only, DO NOT CUT ANYTHING ON THIS LINE!!!

<div style="text-align: center">

	{% include officer/diagonal-line-diagram.html %}
	<figcaption>Drawing the dotted line</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Unfold the **front template** and lay it flat. Draw two solid lines ⅝" from each side of the dotted line on the **right**. Label the outside line _"cut for center/left side"_, and the inside line _"cut for right side."_ Draw another solid line ⅝" to the **left** of the dotted line on the **left**, and label it _"cut for center."_

			{% include officer/front-template.html %}
		</svg>
	</figure>
</div>

Draw a horizontal line (perpendicular to the _center line_) from the center point of the collar to the outer _"cut for center"_ line on the right, and label it _"cut for left side."_

> **FOR "STRAIGHT YOKE" VARIANTS:** Continue the horizontal line from the _center line_ to the solid _"cut for center" line_ on the **left**, and label it _"cut for center."_

<div style="text-align:center">

	</figure>
</div>

### Code Cylinder Pockets
Fold the **front template** down the _center line_ again. Find the vertical midpoint of the sleeve opening, and mark both sides. Unfold the **front template** and draw another dotted line connecting the two marks. This marks the top of where the pockets will be.

> **NOTE:** This dotted line is the _pocket top line_, and again, is for reference only. **DO NOT CUT ANYTHING HERE!!!**

Multiply the seam allowance by 2 (⅝" &times; 2 = 1¼") , and draw two solid horizontal lines that far above and below the dotted _pocket top line_. Label the top line _"cut for bottom"_ and the bottom line _"cut for top."_

> **NOTE:** We double the seam allowance here so we can hide the inner lining seam by offsetting it ⅝" below the top of the pocket opening.

#### Pocket Lining
Draw another horizontal dotted line 4" below the _pocket top line_, and label it _"cut for pocket lining."_

<div style="text-align:center">
	<figure>
		<svg class="PatternPieces__frontTemplate PatternPieces__frontTemplate--C" style="width:186px;height:145px">
			{% include officer/front-template.html %}
		</svg>
	</figure>
</div>

### Center Dart
Draw a **dotted** line on the _center line_ connecting the bottom of the collar to the solid _"cut for top"_ line.

Measure the seam allowance (⅝") from the _center line_ along the collar edge, and draw a solid line to the bottom of the dotted line you just drew. Repeat on the opposite side of the _center line_.

### Final Front Pieces
Now that you have the **front template** with all of the correct markings, you can follow the interactive diagram below to trace out the 9 individual pattern pieces that you need:

<div style="text-align: center" class="PatternPieces__frontPiecesWrapper">
	<figure style="width: 40%">
		<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 185.26 143.16">

				{% include officer/front-template.html %}
			</g>
			{% include officer/pattern-pieces.html %}

		<figcaption>Completed Front Template</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

> Click on an item below to highlight that piece above.

* **2a** Top Left
* **2b** Left Pocket
* **2c** Bottom Left
* **2d** Front Left Lining
* **2e** Front Yoke _(Use **2j** for "straight yoke" variant)_
* **2f** Top Right
* **2g** Right Pocket
* **2h** Bottom Right
* **2i** Front Right Lining
* **2j** Straight Yoke _(Only for "straight yoke" variant)_
{:id="FrontPiecesList"}

> **FOR "NO POCKET" VARIANTS:** You will only need **#2d**, **#2e**, and **#2i**.
>
> **FOR "STRAIGHT YOKE" VARIANTS:** You will need to use **#2j** instead of **#2e**

## "Skirt" Pieces
The "skirt" is the part of the tunic that extends below the _waist-line_ seam. This will need to be modified, since the McCall's pattern has pleats, and the officer tunic does not.

Use the _"Cut here for A"_ line as the bottom edge for _all_ of your new traced pieces.

### Lower Back/Front
Trace **#11** with the _"Center Back Fold line"_ as the left edge, and draw the right edge ⅝" (seam allowance) to the right of the line labeled _"PLEAT"_.

Add a **&darr;Fold&darr;** indicator to the left edge, and label the piece: "**11** Lower Back/Front _(Fabric: cut 4)_."

### Lower Side Back
Trace **#12**, using the vertical _"FOLD LINE"_ as the left edge, and label it: "**12** Lower Side Back _(Fabric: cut 4)_."

### Lower Side Front
Align the bottom edge of **#2i** to the top edge of **#13** on the left corner. Draw a vertical line from the bottom right corner of **#2i** to the _"Cut here for A"_ line on **#13**. With that vertical line as you right edge, trace a new pattern piece, and label it: "**13a** Lower Right Side Front _(Fabric: cut 2)_."

Repeat the above step with **#2d** in place of **#2i**. Label this one: "**13b** Lower Left Side Front _(Fabric: cut 2)_."
