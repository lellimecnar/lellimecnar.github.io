{% include officer/pattern-intro.md %}

The [McCall's pattern](https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m4745) has two coat types:

* **A.** single-breasted, upper-thigh length.
* **B.** double-breasted, above-the-knee length.

The Imperial Officer uniform tunic is sort of a hybrid between the two.

## Back
Trace **#3**, but remove the center seam allowance by drawing the left edge ⅝" inward to the _center line_. Label the new left edge _"Center Back Fold line"_, and add a **&darr;Fold&darr;** indication.

Label this new piece: "**3** Back _(Fabric: cut 1, Lining: cut 1)_."

No modifications are required for **#4**.

> **NOTE:** If the costume you're making is for one of the _very few_ characters that have a center back seam, just mark the center line on your pattern piece for a future step, and you can use **#3** & **#4** unaltered.

## Front
Line up the center line on **#2** with the fold on your tracing fabric, and trace out the rest of the piece. This will be the **front template** that _all_ of the front pieces will be coming from.

<div style="text-align: center">
	<figure>
		{% include officer/mirror-2-diagram.html %}
		<figcaption>Before and after mirroring <strong>#2</strong></figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

With the **front template** folded down the _center line_, mark the half-way point on each shoulder. Overlay the **#3** pattern piece you traced in a previous step, lining up the _center lines_ and _bottom edges_ of the two pieces. Add another mark to the _bottom edge_ of the **front template** at the bottom right corner of **#3**.

Set **#3** aside.

Draw a dotted line between the two marks (being sure to mirror it on both sides of the front template). This marks the seam line for the center yoke.

>**NOTE:** This dotted line is for reference only, DO NOT CUT ANYTHING ON THIS LINE!!!

<div style="text-align: center">
<figure>
	{% include officer/diagonal-line-diagram.html %}
	<figcaption>Drawing the dotted line</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Unfold the **front template** and lay it flat. Draw two solid lines ⅝" from each side of the dotted line on the **right**. Label the outside line _"cut for center/left side"_, and the inside line _"cut for right side."_ Draw another solid line ⅝" to the **left** of the dotted line on the **left**, and label it _"cut for center."_

<div style="text-align:center">
	<figure>
		<svg class="PatternPieces__frontTemplate PatternPieces__frontTemplate--A" style="width:186px;height:145px">
			{% include officer/front-template.html %}
		</svg>
	</figure>
</div>

Draw a horizontal line (perpendicular to the _center line_) from the center point of the collar to the outer _"cut for center/left side"_ line on the right, and label it _"cut for left side."_

> **FOR "STRAIGHT YOKE" VARIANTS:** Continue the horizontal line from the _center line_ to the solid _"cut for center" line_ on the **left**, and label it _"cut for straight yoke."_

<div style="text-align:center">
	<figure>
		<svg class="PatternPieces__frontTemplate PatternPieces__frontTemplate--B" style="width:186px;height:145px">
			{% include officer/front-template.html %}
		</svg>
	</figure>
</div>

### Code Cylinder Pockets
Fold the **front template** down the _center line_ again. Find the vertical midpoint of the sleeve opening, and mark both sides. Unfold the **front template** and draw another dotted line connecting the two marks.

> **NOTE:** This dotted line is the _pocket top line_, and again, is for reference only. **DO NOT CUT ANYTHING HERE!!!**

Draw two solid horizontal lines 1¼" (double the seam allowance) above and below the dotted _pocket top line_. Label the top line _"cut for bottom"_ and the bottom line _"cut for top."_

> **NOTE:** We double the seam allowance here so we can hide the inner lining seam by offsetting it ⅝" below the top of the pocket opening.

#### Pocket Lining
Draw another horizontal dotted line 4" below the dotted _pocket top line_, and label it _"cut for pocket lining."_

<div style="text-align:center">
	<figure>
		<svg class="PatternPieces__frontTemplate PatternPieces__frontTemplate--C" style="width:186px;height:145px">
			{% include officer/front-template.html %}
		</svg>
	</figure>
</div>

### Center Dart
Draw a **dotted** line on the _center line_ connecting the bottom of the collar to the dotted _pocket top line_. With the bottom of this vertical line as the lowest corner, draw an upside-down triangle with the top being ⅝" wide (half of the seam length on either side of the center line).

<div style="text-align: center">
	<figure>
		{% include officer/center-dart-diagram.html %}
		<figcaption>Center Dart</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

> **FOR NO-DART VERSION:** Either skip this step, or just don't transfer onto your center yoke pattern piece.

### Final Front Pieces
Now that you have the **front template** with all of the correct markings, you can follow the interactive diagram below to trace out the 9 individual pattern pieces that you need:

<div style="text-align: center" class="PatternPieces__frontPiecesWrapper">
	<figure style="width: 40%">
		<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 185.26 143.16">
			<g class="PatternPieces__frontTemplate PatternPieces__frontTemplate--final  ">
				{% include officer/front-template.html %}
			</g>
			{% include officer/pattern-pieces.html %}
		</svg>
		<figcaption>Completed Front Template</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

> Click on an item below to highlight that piece above.

* **2a** Top Left
* **2b** Left Pocket
* **2c** Bottom Left
* **2d** Front Left Lining
* **2e** Front Yoke _(Use **2j** for "straight yoke" variant)_
* **2f** Top Right
* **2g** Right Pocket
* **2h** Bottom Right
* **2i** Front Right Lining
* **2j** Straight Yoke _(Only for "straight yoke" variant)_
{:id="FrontPiecesList"}

> **FOR "NO POCKET" VARIANTS:** You will only need **#2d**, **#2e**, and **#2i**.
>
> **FOR "STRAIGHT YOKE" VARIANTS:** You will need to use **#2j** instead of **#2e**

> **TIP:** You could also just use the one template piece, and fold it on the lines to cut your fabric pieces. Though this is a bit more complicated, and harder to explain, it does have the benefit of using less tracing fabric.

## "Skirt" Pieces
The "skirt" is the part of the tunic that extends below the _waist-line_ seam. This will need to be modified, since the McCall's pattern has pleats, and the officer tunic does not.

> **NOTE:** Use the **"Cut here for A"** line as the bottom edge for **all** of your new traced pieces.

### Lower Back/Front
Trace **#11** with the _"Center Back Fold line"_ as the left edge, and draw the right edge ⅝" (seam allowance) to the right of the line labeled _"PLEAT"_.

Add a **&darr;Fold&darr;** indicator to the left edge, and label the piece: "**11** Lower Back/Front _(Fabric: cut 4)_."

### Lower Side Back
Trace **#12**, using the vertical _"FOLD LINE"_ as the left edge, and label it: "**12** Lower Side Back _(Fabric: cut 4)_."

### Lower Side Front
Align the bottom edge of **#2i** to the top edge of **#13** on the left corner. Draw a vertical line from the bottom right corner of **#2i** to the _"Cut here for A"_ line on **#13**. With that vertical line as you right edge, trace a new pattern piece, and label it: "**13a** Lower Right Side Front _(Fabric: cut 2)_."

Repeat the above step with **#2d** in place of **#2i**. Label this one: "**13b** Lower Left Side Front _(Fabric: cut 2)_."

> **NOTE:** You may need to extend beyond the width of **#13** when you trace **#13b**. Just make sure your right edge is vertical.
