## Introduction

After making my [Old Luke costume](/costuming/luke-tfa.html), I decided that I wanted to sew some more Star Wars costumes, so I set out to find another project. I settled on the Imperial Officer uniform because it involved a lot of sewing, and not a lot of non-fabric parts.

I already had the [McCall's M4745 pattern](https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m4745) that I used to make the under tunic for my Luke costume, so I decided to use that as a starting point.

I decided that since there are so many different types of Imperial Officer uniforms, and they're mostly identical, I'm going to put together some patterns that I can re-use and make as many of the different varieties as I want.

## Officer Variations
There are several variations of the officer uniform, in three colors: olive, white, and black. The rank of each officer is conveyed by a rank bar attached to the front of the tunic over the wearer's left breast.
